### 📝 Abstract
This project addresses the **'Contextual Gap'** in financial fraud detection by transitioning from static transaction analysis to **dynamic behavioural profiling**. Using the IEEE-CIS dataset, I engineered a **Cost-Sensitive Gradient Boosting framework** that achieves a **ROC-AUC of 0.9054**. Key contributions include a **deterministic Entity Resolution protocol** and novel **Time-Behaviour Deviation features** that detect **high-velocity mimicry attacks** without relying on **synthetic data augmentation (SMOTE)**.
