Context-Aware Fraud Detection Framework
Bridging the Contextual Gap: A Behaviour-Based Approach using Cost-Sensitive XGBoost
This repository contains the implementation of a Context-Aware Fraud Detection Prototype designed to detect sophisticated "behavioural mimicry" in high-dimensional, stateless financial datasets (IEEE-CIS).

Unlike traditional static models, this framework reconstructs dynamic user profiles from anonymous transaction logs using a novel Entity Resolution protocol and Cost-Sensitive Gradient Boosting.
